Please read these Terms (“Terms”). By using SkateRoute, you agree to them.

## 1. Eligibility & Account
You must be **13+** to use SkateRoute. You are responsible for your account, device, and any content you post.

## 2. Safety & Responsibility
Skate within your limits and obey local laws. Do not trespass, obstruct traffic, or ride where prohibited. Routes, hazard data, surfaces, and elevation are **informational only** and may be inaccurate or incomplete. Use judgment at all times.

## 3. User-Generated Content (UGC)
You own your UGC. By posting, you grant SkateRoute a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, adapt, publish, and display your UGC in the app for the purpose of operating and improving the service. We strip media EXIF on upload. We may remove or moderate UGC that violates these Terms.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You agree **not** to:
- Post illegal, hateful, harassing, or deceptive content
- Dox, stalk, or invade others’ privacy
- Upload malware, attempt to scrape, or reverse engineer
- Falsify hazards/spots or manipulate leaderboards
- Promote dangerous activity, property damage, or trespass
- Impersonate others or misrepresent affiliation

## 5. Moderation
We may use community reports, trust signals, and partner reviews to moderate posts and edits. Repeat or severe violations may lead to content removal or account restriction.

## 6. Paid Features & Subscriptions
Some optional features require a one-time purchase or subscription. Purchases are handled by Apple’s App Store; billing terms and refunds follow Apple policies. **Safety features (e.g., hazard alerts, rerouting) remain free** and are not paywalled. We do not use dark patterns.

## 7. Rewards & Partners
From time to time, you may see promotions or partner offers. Redemption codes/QRs are single-use, time-limited, and have **no cash value**. Partners are solely responsible for their offers. We are not liable for partner goods or services.

## 8. Intellectual Property
SkateRoute, the app, and our branding are owned by us or our licensors. Do not use our marks without permission.

## 9. Disclaimers
THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. ROUTES, HAZARD DATA, AND SURFACE/ROUGHNESS ESTIMATES ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF SAFETY. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SKATEROUTE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO SKATEROUTE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM OR (B) USD $20, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

## 11. Indemnity
You will indemnify SkateRoute for claims arising from your UGC or your misuse of the service.

## 12. Termination
You may stop using the app at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or to protect users or the service.

## 13. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law
Before filing a claim, contact **legal@skateroute.app** to attempt informal resolution. These Terms are governed by the laws of **British Columbia, Canada**, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Where permitted, disputes will be brought in the courts of British Columbia. You and SkateRoute waive class actions to the fullest extent allowed by law.

## 14. Changes
We may update these Terms. We snapshot Terms at each release; material changes will be announced in-app. Continued use after changes means you accept the revised Terms.
